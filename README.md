Doubts: In mint process should i assume client 4 is also capable of giving the random id for the coin, since ops
inside servers cannot run same code to generate random id for the coin.
cd build/install/library && ./smartrun.sh intol.dti.imp.client.DTIInteractiveClient 4
cd build/install/library && ./smartrun.sh intol.dti.imp.server.DTIServer 0
